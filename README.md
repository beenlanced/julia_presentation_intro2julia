## Project Description

Project folder housing numerous Julia coded examples, text files, and Jupyter notebooks showcasing the Julia programming language for a Machine Learning Meetup presetation, Learning Tuesday Talk, or general tech chat.

The notebooks are the perfect aid to help introduce those new to Julia about key Julia features and highlight Julia performance benefits.


## Objective

I am a big fan and supporter of [Julia](https://julialang.org/). To better understand the programming language I put this project together
to educate myself and to be able to present to others.

## Getting Started

You will need to install Julia and IJulia to utilize the Jupyter notebooks in this repository. Then, clone the repository and you are ready to go.


## Installation Steps

### Install Julia

You will need at least Julia version 0.6.2

1. **juliaup**

A recommended way to install Julia is to install [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) which is a small, self-contained binary that will automatically install the latest stable Julia binary and help keep it up to date. It also supports installing and using different versions of Julia simultaneously.

Install `juliaup` by running this in your terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

```

This will install the latest stable version of Julia, which can be launched from a command-line by typing `julia` as well as the `juliaup` tool. To install different Julia versions see `juliaup --help`.

2. **Downloads**
   If you want to manually download and install specific Julia versions, see the [Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/) page.

### Install IJulia to Use Jupyter Notebooks

Install `IJulia` using instructions [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)



## Review the Notebooks

Each notebook is a hodgepode of different topics illustrating Julia functionality and performance.
